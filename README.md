# Covid Image Classification using CNN framework
In the past few years, it has been observerd that a global pandemic (COVID 19), 
posing previously unheard-of difficulties for economies, healthcare systems, and public 
health across the globe. Coronavirus disease is a respiratory infectious disease caused by the 
SARS-CoV-2 virus. It was urgently needed to detect and diagnose disease early at that time. 
As one of the most effective methods of detecting infection, the RT-PCR test was found to 
be time consuming, not so accurate, giving strategic boost to AI-based deep-learning CNN 
Covid detection methods that are relatively quick with chest X-rays, which are becoming 
increasingly common. In this context, the proposed work utilized of X-Ray dataset for covid 
identification by using pretrained CNN architectures. Furthermore the proposed CNN 
framework showed the state of the art accruracy on the Covid radio graphy dataset.
